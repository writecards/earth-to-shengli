        <p id = "descriptiontext">HUMAN ￮ CIRCUIT is an interactive visual installation that is influenced by my personal experience reemerging into normal life after almost a year of solitude. Pairing self-constructed capacitive sensors with Arduino and Processing, HUMAN ￮ CIRCUIT projects visuals onto a screen when two or more people join hands with the sensors. Prior research included inspirations such as Messe Di Voce by Golan Levin, and Manuela Donoso’s Walllight. 
              These projects demonstrate different components of interaction: Levin’s piece invites continued exploration of a certain movement or sound by continuously generating visuals on the screen, while the emphasis of Walllight is to invite multiple participants to interact with the space. 
              Conceptually, my goal for this project was to fuse these two components together, by generating visuals that respond when multiple people join hands with the sensors.

    <p id = "descriptiontext">In recent years, the wildfire situation in California has become alarmingly destructive and severe. What exactly are the trends in California's wildfire data? Why do these patterns exist?
      This data visualization project hightlights wildfires in California from 2013-2021, focusing specifically on where and when they tend to occur, in order to raise awareness on the effects of human-induced climate change on the West Coast.

    <p id = "descriptiontext">I approached this project with a focus on how to structure a visual narrative in order to make it appealing to the general reader. After exploring various formats, I decided to go with a "martini-glass" structure: key facts in the start (top 20 most destructive wildfires), followed by a chronology of events (attempted with the voronoi map), and a strong ending/kicker, which is the heatmap of all of the wildfires. Supplemented with text and images, I used this intentional structure in hopes of creating a narrative that is informative but not too overwhelming. By putting the visualizations in this order, I hoped to feed the reader's curiosity to find out more about the reasoning behind the data.</p>
